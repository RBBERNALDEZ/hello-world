Learning Git and Github!
========================

Subheadline
========================

**Github** is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, providing developers with tools for version control and collaboration. It combines Git, a powerful version control system, with features that facilitate collaboration and project management.
**Git** is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code and collaborate with others. 
The **branch system** in Git allows developers to work individually on a task **(For example: One branch -> One task OR One branch -> One developer)**. Basically think of Git as a small software application that controls your code base, if youâ€™re a developer.

The **terminal commands**, also known as the **command line interface (CLI)**, is a powerful tool that allows users to interact with their computers by typing text commands. 

By using GitHub, you make it easier to **get excellent documentation**. Their help section and guides have articles for nearly any topic related to Git that you can think of.
